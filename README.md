# Loekaars' Minecraft Datapack Generator

## How to use

`dpg`

## Things

This is my first npm package so I don't know if this works.  
If you can't run `dpg` from your command line, try `npm link`  
in the directory you downloaded it in.

I am aware of the fact that my code is spaghetti, but I'll fix it someday.
